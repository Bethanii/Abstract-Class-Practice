# Abstract-Class-Practice

Class assignment instructions: 

1.	Create an Abstract Class named Book.
2.	Within Book, create a private string for the id string
3.	Within Book, create a constructor that takes the id string as a parameter.  The body of the constructor will set the private string equal to the argument passed.
4.	Create (auto-implement if you want to) two read-write properties for Book.  
a.	Author
b.	BookTitle
5.	Within Book, create an abstract string method named Message();

6.	Create two child classes for Book – one named ReferenceBook and the other named TextBook
7.	In both, create the proper constructor (see the example mentioned above)
8.	In both, override the Message method.  Have it return a string that would be appropriate for the book type.

9.	Back in Main(), ask for the ID string of both book types.  Then do the following:
a.	Create an instance of each book type (ReferenceBook and TextBook)
b.	Ask for and assign each book instance’s Author and Title (save to the Author and BookTitle properties)
c.	Call a DisplayBook method that you created in the Program class.  Make it display the Author & BookTitle properties, as well as the output of the Message() method for each instance
